## **Project Insight**

The Power BI dashboard provided clear, actionable insights:

Stakeholders identified the most battery-intensive devices (iPhone 12).
Gender and age-wise patterns informed app design customization (e.g., focusing on adult users).
The scatter plot on data usage by the number of apps installed helped identify heavy app users for targeted offers.
Simplified decision-making for marketing strategies and device-specific optimization.
Your work highlighted your ability to use data visualization tools effectively to communicate complex datasets in an easy-to-understand manner
